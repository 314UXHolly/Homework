What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file. You should see that now both files are listed as untracked files.

To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new master branch.
